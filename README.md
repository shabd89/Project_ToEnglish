# Project_ToEnglish
Creating python programs to Translate Indian language Text to English Text (not just a Googletrans)
I was working for a practice project to get insights from a 'Census of India' Data (year 1971) using Python-Machine learning
But I encountered a challenge where many of the fields were in Hindi
I tried to convert those features in English But the most used Python library used for this purpose : that is 'googletrans' was not effective.As this simply translate Hindi word in English as a 'meaning' rather than Transliterate (converting text as in English characters)

I started with Hindi to English But had later, found some more excels of online school data in other Indian texts.
